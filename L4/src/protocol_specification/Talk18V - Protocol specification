Talk18V

Protocol specification:

-This protocol uses a TCP-connection.

-You can only communicate with one server at a time and the server can only communicate with one client at a time.

-The Talk-client must ask the Talk-server, whether it wants to establish a communication between them.

-Once the Talk-client or the Server-client has sent a message, it can't send any additional messages, until a message has been received. The same rule applies to the Talk-client.

-The user must specify which server it wants to communicate with, by establishing a link to the server, by specifying the servers' IP-Address & port number.
